| **Player Activity Log**        | When tracking player interactions in the game, the user needs to view a detailed log of each playerâ€™s activities (including player ID, actions, and timestamps) so they can monitor and analyze player behavior over time. |
| **Suspicious Activity Detection** | When monitoring player actions for abnormal behavior, the user needs to be alerted about suspicious activities, such as repeated identical actions or actions performed at inhuman speeds, so they can quickly identify and address potentially malicious behavior. |
| **Player Status**              | When managing player activity and access, the user needs the ability to view and update the status of each player (e.g., active, suspicious, banned) so they can take appropriate action based on observed behavior. |
| **Manual Review**              | When reviewing flagged activities, the user needs a way to manually review each activity and mark it as legitimate or malicious so that they can ensure accurate classification and take action as needed. |
